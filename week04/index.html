				<p>This is a demonstration of how <a href="https://getboostrap.com">Bootstrap</a> can make our lives easier. We don't have to spend a lot of time doing boilerplate/grunt css work to get our instructional design ideas up as prototypes.</p>

				<h2>Classes</h2>
				<p>In Bootstrap, classes are very important. Make sure you are very mindful of classes.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Hierarchy</h2>
				<p>In Bootstrap, the hierarchy of classes to build more complex "parts" or components is important. Be mindful of what specific classes are being utilized as a parent > child > child-of-child.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>CSS</h2>
				<p>In Bootstrap, the class names are arbitrary in the sense that they are no different than class names you would come up with. Each class is assigned to a particular set of CSS rules. In studying, it's important that you get a "gist" of what the classes you are applying are actually doing.</p>
