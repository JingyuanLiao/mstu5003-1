			Yusei Matsui is the mangaka on everybodyâ€™s mind. Author of the wildly popular Assassination Classroom, Matsui has created one of the best-loved, and bestselling, manga in both Japan and the U.S. in recent years. An action-packed comedy in which middle school misfits face off against their smiley-faced alien teacher, Assassination Classroom has been a <img src="https://placehold.it/50x50"> consistent New York Times bestseller, and was adapted into a popular anime series and hit live-action film. Matsui joins us at Japan Society for an intimate conversation in conjunction with New York Comic Con, a rare opportunity to see the manga master in person. Moderated by animator/producer Justin Leach. Followed by a reception.
